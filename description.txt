This project provides a simple setup for creating an image scroll effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The setup includes a responsive layout with a full-screen black background and a container element for the images with a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

The container element uses the flexbox layout with a horizontal gap between the images. 

Each image has a fixed aspect ratio and is centered inside its container using the object-fit and object-position CSS properties. 

The images also have a border radius to give them a rounded shape.

The JavaScript code provides the functionality for scrolling through the images using the mouse. 

When the user clicks on the window and drags the mouse left or right, the images container moves horizontally in the opposite direction. 

The amount of movement is proportional to the distance between the mouse click and the mouse position, and the maximum distance is half of the screen width. 

This creates a smooth scrolling effect that follows the user's mouse movements.

The code is simple and easy to customize, allowing developers to use their own images and adjust the styling and behavior to fit their needs. 

The project can be used as a starting point for building image galleries, sliders, or other interactive web components that require horizontal scrolling.
